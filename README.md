# Ethical Hacking Portfolio
This repository documents my practical work in ethical hacking, with a focus on Linux systems for now, misconfiguration-driven exploitation, and privilege escalation.  
It is built through Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and lab environments, and structured to reflect real-world penetration testing methodology rather than step-by-step walkthroughs.

## Focus Areas
- Network and service reconnaissance
- Initial access through misconfigurations
- Linux privilege escalation
- Post-exploitation analysis
- Defensive remediation and hardening
  
## Repository Structure
- `walk-throughs/`  
  End-to-end attack narratives for selected CTFs, this will use a walkthrough approach.

- `linux/`  
  Reusable Linux exploitation techniques and privilege escalation methods, written as standalone technical notes.

- `web/`  
  Web exploitation techniques.

## Current Work
- Exploiting Kioptrix 1.2 and documenting the findings in `walk-throughs/`
- Also adding the used access and priv-esc techniques in the linux section and web section when applicable
