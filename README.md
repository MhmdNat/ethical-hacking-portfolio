# Ethical Hacking Portfolio

This repository documents my practical work in ethical hacking, with a focus on Linux systems for now, misconfiguration-driven exploitation, and privilege escalation.  
It is built through Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and lab environments, and structured to reflect real-world penetration testing methodology rather than step-by-step walkthroughs.

## Focus Areas
- Network and service reconnaissance
- Initial access through misconfigurations
- Linux privilege escalation
- Post-exploitation analysis
- Defensive remediation and hardening

## Repository Structure
- `case-studies/`  
  End-to-end attack narratives for selected CTFs, this will use a walkthrough approach .

- `linux/`  
  Reusable Linux exploitation techniques and privilege escalation methods, written as standalone technical notes.

- `web/`  
  Web exploitation techniques.

- `methodology/`  
  Notes on reconnaissance, exploitation workflow, and general pentesting approach.

- `remediation/`  
  Defensive recommendations and secure configuration practices based on observed vulnerabilities.

## Current Work
- Adding basic linux initial access and priv-esc vectors as stand alone techniques
- Will start working on CTF and lab environments with structured walk-throughs and remediation techniques
