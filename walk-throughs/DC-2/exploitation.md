# Exploitation of DC-2 Virtual Machine
Exploitation focusing on credential discovery and credential reuse

## Building wordlist through `cewl`
A custom wordlist was built and saved into a `passwords.txt` file 
```bash
cewl http://dc-2 > passwords.txt
```

## Wordpress Credentials Brute Force
Since the target application was identified as Wordpress, credential brute forcing was performed with wpscan in addition to the username list found in the `scanning-and-enumeration` section and the wordlist generated via `cewl`. This resulted in the discovery of two valid credentials:
- `tom:parturient`
- `jerry:adipiscing`

## Wordpress Login
I logged into Wordpress using the wp-admin portal, 
Tom's credentials:
  Nothing that directly allows exploitation was found, following the hint in the first flag, jerry's credentials were next
Jerry's credentials:
  In the pages tab, the second flag was found, which hinted to use another attack vector. Had it not been for this hint, I would have tried PHP related exploitations; hpowever, I decided to move on with SSH as we already have credentials

## Initial Access through SSH
After Logging in through SSH using Tom's credentials with `ssh -p 7744 tom@<dc-2 ip>`, the reuse of Wordpress credentials indicates improper credential seperation, which allowed unauthorized remote shell access 
During local enumeration, it was identified that the obtained shell was a restricted Bash (rbash) environment. Absolute paths and certain shell characters were restricted, and common commands such as `cat` could not be executed.
