# Exploitation of DC-2 Virtual Machine
Exploitation focusing on credential discovery and cross-service credential reuse.

## Building wordlist through `cewl`
A custom wordlist was built and saved into a `passwords.txt` file to generate a content-based wordlist derived from the application.
```bash
cewl http://dc-2 > passwords.txt
```

## WordPress Credentials Brute Force
Since the target application was identified as WordPress, credential brute forcing was performed with wpscan in combination with the username list and the wordlist generated via `cewl`. This resulted in the discovery of two valid WordPress user credentials:
- `tom:parturient`
- `jerry:adipiscing`

## WordPress Login
Both credential sets were tested against WordPress authentication; however, no direct exploitation vectors allowing remote code execution were identified at this stage. Exposed content revealed the second flag indicating that WordPress was not the intended access vector, which prompted testing the credentials on other exposed services such as SSH.

## Initial Access through SSH
After logging in through SSH using Tom's credentials with `ssh -p 7744 tom@<dc-2 ip>`, the reuse of WordPress credentials indicated improper credential separation across services,resulting in unauthorized remote shell access. During local enumeration, it was identified that the obtained shell was a restricted Bash (rbash) environment. Absolute paths and certain shell metacharacters were restricted, and common commands such as `cat` could not be executed.
