# Exploitation of DC-2 Virtual Machine
Exploitation focusing on brute-forcing SSH credentials with the aqquired username and password list

## Building wordlist through `cewl`
A custom wordlist was built and saved into a `passwords.txt` file 
```bash
cewl http://dc-2 > passwords.txt
```

## Wordpress Credentials Brute Force
Since this web application is built with wordpress, the first idea would be to brute force the credentials using wpscan and the accquired name list and wordlist
Valid credentials were:
- `tom:parturient`
- `jerry:adipiscing`

## Wordpress Login
I logged into Wordpress using the wp-admin portal, 
First using tom:
  Nothing direct was found, -------------------------------------------

## Credentials Brute Forcing with `hydra`
The `wp-usernames.txt` and `passwords.txt` files that were previously accquired were used with hydra to crack SSH credentials on the 7744 port were SSH is exposed
```bash
hydra -s 7744 -L wp-usernames.txt -P passwords.txt ssh://<dc-2 ip>
```
`tom:parturient` were found as valid SSH credentials
>_*NOTE*_ Due to the nature of hydra were it stops brute forcing after finding the first valid pair, I removed admin and tom from the `wp-usernames.txt` file, and the above command was repeated

The final findings related to SSH credentials were:
  - `tom:parturient`
  - `jerry:
