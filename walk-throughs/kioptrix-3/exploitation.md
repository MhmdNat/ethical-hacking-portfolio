# Exploitation of Kioptrix-3
After confirming an `SQLi` vulnerability, this phase demonstrates the actions used to gain an initial foothold on the target machine.

## Database Enumeration and Credential Extraction
Given the confirmed SQL injection point, automated exploitation was performed using sqlmap to enumerate database contents.
Database names were obtained using:
```bash
sqlmap --batch -u "http://kioptrix3.com/gallery/gallery.php?task=delete&id=1" --dbs
```
The database of interest is `gallery` which was also enumerated using the `-D gallery` flag revealing the presence of a `dev_accounts` table.


Data in this table was successfully dumped using `-D gallery -T dev_accounts --dump` flags, revealing two developer accounts and their corresponding hashed passwords. 


`sqlmap` successfully cracked these hashed passwords revealing the developer credentials.
- dreg:Mast3r
- loneferret:starwars
  
These credentials were considered high-value due to the exposed SSH service, presenting a potential case of credential reuse across services.


Initial access through the exposed `SSH` service was gained on both accounts. However, the `dreg` user was exposed to a restrictive shell environment, which limited further interaction. As a result, the loneferret account was used as the primary foothold due to providing a standard interactive shell.
