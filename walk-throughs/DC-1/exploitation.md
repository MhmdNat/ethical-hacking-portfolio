# Exploitation of DC-1 virtual machine
Exploitation focusing on the attack vector targeting the Drupal 7 CVE to gain initial access

## Metasploit Framework
I chose MSF for reliability and speed as this exploit has been tested on it
- I started by first searching on msf console for drupal 7 exploits, I found `multi/http/drupal_drupageddon` which aligned with online sources. The exploit leverages specially crafted SQLi to execute PHP code and achieve RCE
- After setting RHOSTS to \<dc-1 ip\>, I ran the exploit and gained initial foothold as the web server user (www-data) with limited privileges
- Although this achieved system access it is not yet a full system compromise
