# Exploitation
This phase focuses on extracting valid credentials from sniffed packets and gaining an initial foothold through SSH.

## Investigating the `.pcap` file
Analysis of the `.pcap` file revealed FTP traffic containing unencrypted authentication data. Since FTP transmits credentials in plaintext, the username and password could be extracted by inspecting the FTP USER and PASS commands within the capture. The following credentials were identified:
- Username: Nathan
- Password: Buck3tH4TF0RM3!

## Cross-Service Credential Reuse
The extracted credentials were associated with the FTP service; however, they were also tested against SSH. 
```bash
ssh Nathan@<cap ip>
```
Due to credential reuse, the same username and password successfully authenticated against SSH, resulting in an initial foothold as a non-root user in the target machine.
